\chapter{Introducing Lindenmayer Systems}

Aristid Lindenmayer is well known biologist who started work on what would become known as the Lindenmayer System or L-system for short. Originally they were intended to be used as a grammar for describing the development of simple organisms. However over the years they have been found to be useful in describing larger organisms and even non organic structures like music. \cite{worth2005growing}
