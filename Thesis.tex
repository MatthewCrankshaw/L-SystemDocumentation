\chapter{Introducing Lindenmayer Systems}

Aristid Lindenmayer is well known biologist who started work on what would become known as the Lindenmayer System or L-system for short. Originally L-systems were intended to be used as a grammar for describing the development of simple organisms. However over the years they have been found to be useful in describing larger organisms and even non organic structures like music. \cite{worth2005growing} \\
\\
In order to talk about the more complex L-systems such as the 2L-system which is used to describe structures like plants and trees. I first need to talk about how L-systems are described as well as how string rewriting works. The most simple form of L-system is a non parametric DOL-system.
