I want to start by thanking my supervisor Dr. Daniel Playne for all of your support, guidance, and feedback during the course of this thesis. Additionally, I would like to acknowledge Dr. Martin Johnson. You have both been an inspiration not just to myself but to all of your students studying Computer Science. \\
\\
\noindent
My deepest gratitude goes to my colleagues Dara Quach and Richard Kim, in the center for parallel computing for their assistance and friendship. \\
\\
\noindent
I certainly would not be where I am today if it weren't for my siblings, mother, and father for their continued love and support.\\
\\
\noindent
Finally, to my beloved fianc\'{e}e Romana, thank you for your unwavering support and encouragement throughout the last year of study and in the writing process of this thesis. This  would not be possible without you.
