I would like to start by thanking my supervisor Dr Daniel Playne for all of your support, guidence and feedback during the course of this thisis. Additionally I would like to acknowledge Dr Martin Johnson. You have both been an inspiration not just to myself but to all of your students studying Computer Science. \\
\\
\noindent
A very special gratitude goes to my colleagues Dara and Richard in the center for parallel computing for their assistance and friendship. \\
\\
\noindent
I certainly would not be where I am today if it weren't for my siblings, mother and father for their continued love and support.\\
\\
\noindent
Finally, to my beloved fianc\'{e}e Romana, thank you for your unwaivering support and encouragement throughout the last year of study, and in the writing process or this thesis. This accomplishment would not be possible without you.
