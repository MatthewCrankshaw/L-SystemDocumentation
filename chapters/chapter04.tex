\section{Motion Equations}

Torque\\
$ \tau = I\alpha $ \\
Where $\tau$ is the torque, $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.\\
\\
$ \tau = f \otimes R $ \\
Where $\tau$ is the torque, $f$ is the force acting on the end of the branch and $R$ is the vector representing the length and orientation of the branch. \\
\\
Mass \\
$ M = \Pi~ r ^ 2 h $  \\
Where $M$ is the mass represented in kg, $r$ is the radius of the branch in meters and $h$ is the height of the branch in meters. \\
\\
Inertia\\
$ I = \frac{1}{3} M L ^ 2 $ \\ 
Where $I$ is the inertia of the branch, $M$ is the Mass of the branch and $h$ is the height of the branch. \\
\\
Angular Acceleration\\
$ \omega = \omega _0 \alpha t $ \\
Where $\omega$ is the angular velocity, $\omega _0 $ is the previous angular velocity, $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration and $t$ is the change in time. \\
\\
Next angle equation\\
$ \theta = \theta _0 + \omega _0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t ^2 $ \\
Where $\theta$ is the angle, $\theta _0$ is the previous angle, $w _0$ is the previous angular velocity, t is the change in time and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration. \\

\section{Hook's Law}

$ f = -k _s x + k _d v$\\
Where $f$ is the force exerted by the spring, $k _s$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the total displacement of the spring. We then would also like to add a dampening force which is the $k _d v$ part where $k _d$ is the dampening constant and $v$ is the velocity at the end of the spring.\\
